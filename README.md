# Chess_Playing_3D_Printer
I started with one of the original RepRap 3D printers and modified it to play chess. The first thing I did was scrap the arduino board and replaced it with a Raspberry Pi Model 3. Then I removed the nozzel and its motor and replaced it with a non-captive stepper motor. I used this motor and its pass-thru screw as the Z-axis of the machine. At the end of the screw I attached a 5 volt electro-magnet. On each chess piece I glued on a small cap cut off from a common nail. This allowed me to lower the electro-magnet and pick up any chess piece. The entire chess board was moved in the Y direction  by a second stepper motor and a third stepper was used to move the pick-up screw in the X direction. On the Raspberry Pi I added 2 Adafruit motor hats which allowed me to control all three motors. I also used a mosfet to switch on and off the electromagnet. The code is compiled with the GNU C++ compiler and the wiringPi library is used to control the mechanics. The current configuration is that the user plays white against the machine which plays black. The machines moves are generated by gnuchess. I don't have the time (or knowkedge) to write my own chess engine. The machine motors are very slow so it takes about 60 seconds to mechanically make a move. Another problem is that the electro-magnet sometimes fails to grab a piece. So, yes there is a lot of room for improvements.
